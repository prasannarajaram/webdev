<!-- Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the
visitor enters another number – ask him to input again.

The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a
number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no
 need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this
 task.
